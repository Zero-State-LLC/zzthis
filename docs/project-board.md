# Project board

The family board is live: [zzThis + zzThat](https://github.com/orgs/Zero-State-LLC/projects/25) (org project 25).

Do not create a second board.

## Status

The single-select field is `Status`. Options, in order:

| Option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Backlog | Filed, not ready to build |
| Ready | Spec and acceptance are enough to start |
| In progress | Someone is building it |
| In review | A pull request is open |
| Done | Merged, or the question is closed |

## Repository

GitHub's built-in Repository field shows which repo an item comes from. There is no custom Repo field.

## Automation

`.github/workflows/project-collaboration.yml` points at project 25. On a new issue or pull request it adds the item and sets Status to `Backlog` when `PROJECT_TOKEN` can see the board. A missing token or a missing status option warns and still posts the team comment. The workflow does not close the issue.

Ready, In progress, In review, and Done are set on the board by hand.
